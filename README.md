Playlist manager for ballroom dances.

Niche application. For ballroom dance practice parties, or social dance parties,
it is typical to play music appropriate to a number of different dances. A DJ would
choose the dances as the event goes along, but that requires a dedicated DJ who cannot
also dance, and also typically requires some sort of a DJ booth that faces the dance
floor.

A step up in automation is the use of digital music aggregated into a playlist. This
still requires someone taking time to create the playlist. I dance at a place now that
plays the same two playlists every week.

Next step up, this program generates a playlist semirandomly, using a set of rules
to determine the frequency and placing of different dance types.

Development is in progress, as this is a little exercise in web development for me.
